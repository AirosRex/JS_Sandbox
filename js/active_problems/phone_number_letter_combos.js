/**
 * Given a string containing exclusively digits (0-9), return all
 * possible letter combinations that the number could represent.
 * 
 * A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below.
 * Note that 0 and 1 just map to themselves since they don't have characters.
 * 0 => 0
 * 1 => 1
 * 2 => abc
 * 3 => def
 * 4 => ghi
 * 5 => jkl
 * 6 => mno
 * 7 => pqrs
 * 8 => tuv
 * 9 => wxyz
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: digits = "23"
 * Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: digits = ""
 * Output: []
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: digits = "2"
 * Output: ["a","b","c"]
